## What is this?
This package contains work in progress components that are not yet ready for production.<br/>
Use the components with caution, they can be buggy and APIs might change!

## How to Import from the lab?
Components from the lab will eventually be part of the core package, sometimes as a new component, other times replacing an existing one.

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'wix-style-react/lab';
```
